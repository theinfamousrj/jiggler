# jiggler
This is a mouse jiggler. Actually, two mouse jigglers.

It uses actual hardware so you can use this on computers that don't allow you to install things.

## software
Here you can find the [installation instructions](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html) for all of the teensy stuff you need to get started.

## hardware
### my hardware
I run this on a [Teensy 3.X](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html)

I plug it in, it works. Mac/PC/etc. The computer thinks it's a mouse.

### other hardware
You can probably run this just the same on a [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html)
